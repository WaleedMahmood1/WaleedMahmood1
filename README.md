## About me
With an academic background in Economics, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, my career began in economic research where I had the pleasure of working with academics to design, implement and evaluate a research study in public health ‚Äì after the completion of my BSc. (Hons.) in Economics with a minor in Mathematics. The exposure to working with data and various analytical methods heightened my interest in data science methods. Recognizing this interest for deeper data science knowledge, I pursued my Master of Data Science from the University of British Columbia in 2023. During the course of the master‚Äôs program, I had the opportunity of collaborating with peers from a plethora of domains on a multitude of projects ranging from predictive analytics to software development. Following the completion of the course, in order to build on my passion for data-driven insights, I also founded [PegasusAI](https://www.pegasusaiconsulting.com/), where I serve as the Data Scientist and Lead Economist, channeling my expertise to craft innovative AI solutions that empower businesses. In addition to this, I am currently engaged at the Pakistan Canada Trade Association as a Commercial Attache. With a continued focus on economic research and data-driven analysis, I co-authored the publication [The Political Economy of Debt](https://asiafoundation.org/publication/the-political-economy-of-debt/) for the Asia Foundation. This work delved into the economic and political implications of unreported financial obligations, providing recommendations to enhance fiscal transparency and stability, further reinforcing my commitment to leveraging data for meaningful impact.
